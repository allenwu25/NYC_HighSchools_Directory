		"description": "Juan Morel Campos Secondary School works to balance experiences in the arts with college readiness activities for all students. Every student at Campos takes daily talent classes of their choice; students become musicians, singers, actors, and visual artists. Partnerships with major community arts organizations, CUNY's PERC program, and the College Bound Initiative (CBI) ensure that students also connect their learning to the real world and have the opportunity to teach and learn from one another. For example, students conduct gallery openings at professional galleries throughout the city, co-teach STEM classes with teachers in the PERC program, and begin visiting colleges as ninth graders. In addition, an in-house college counselor ensures that students are prepared for college acceptance and enrollment upon graduation. We are small enough to give every student the attention they deserve while being large enough to offer a wide variety of courses and activities during and after the school day. Beginning early in high school, students at Campos visit colleges, earn college credits through Advanced Placement (AP) and CUNY courses, play sports, take on leadership roles, participate in a wide variety of after-school activities, learn about careers in the arts, and are surrounded by teams of adults who offer all of the academic and social support they need to succeed in school. We are prepared to serve any student and value a diverse and richly talented school community.",
